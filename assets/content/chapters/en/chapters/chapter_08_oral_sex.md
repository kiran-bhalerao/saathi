# Chapter 8: Using Your Mouth

## Oral Sex Basics — A Soft Approach to Pleasure

## A Little Story

You can eat ice cream with a spoon.

Or you can lick it directly.

With the spoon, you taste it. Nice.

But when you lick? The cold, the sweetness, the texture — everything hits your tongue directly. Intense!

The spoon works. But the tongue... the tongue is special.

## What Is Oral Sex?

Let's be clear:

**Oral sex** = using the mouth (lips, tongue) to give pleasure to your partner's private parts.

**For him:** Mouth on penis

**For her:** Mouth on vulva and clitoris

Both are forms of oral sex. Both can be incredibly pleasurable.

## Why Is This Effective for Women?

Remember the clitoris? 8,000 nerve endings in a tiny spot?

Now think about what touches it best:

- Fingers are good... but can be rough
- During sex, contact is often indirect

But the tongue?

- Soft
- Wet
- Precise
- Can maintain constant, gentle rhythm

For many women, oral sex is the **easiest way to reach orgasm**.

## Let's Clear Up the Myths

Before we go further, let's address some common misconceptions:

**Myth 1: "Good wives don't do this"**

Reality: Oral sex is practiced by loving couples across all cultures and backgrounds. It's not about being "good" or "bad" — it's about sharing pleasure and intimacy.

**Myth 2: "It's only for his pleasure"**

Reality: Oral sex on women (clitoris) is often MORE effective for female orgasm than penetration. Many women who rarely climax during intercourse find it easy during oral. This is FOR HER pleasure.

**Myth 3: "It's dirty or unhygienic"**

Reality: A clean body is just... a body. Showering beforehand makes oral sex as hygienic as kissing. Healthy skin tastes neutral — slightly salty at most.

**Myth 4: "If I try it once, I'll have to do it forever"**

Reality: You can explore, decide it's not for you, and never do it again. No obligations. Trying something doesn't mean committing to it forever.

**Myth 5: "It's degrading"**

Reality: When done with mutual love, respect, and consent, oral sex is an act of intimacy and care — not degradation. Giving pleasure to someone you love is beautiful.

## But Isn't It... Dirty?

Let's address this worry directly, because it stops many couples from even trying.

Think about this:

- Your phone screen touches 100 different surfaces daily. You touch it constantly.
- Your money has passed through thousands of hands. You touch it.
- Doorknobs, tables, handrails — touched without thinking.

A clean vulva? Washed with water? It's actually **cleaner than most things you already touch!**

Healthy skin tastes like... skin. Slightly salty. That's it.

If you're worried, shower together before intimacy. Problem solved.

The "disgust" many people feel is cultural conditioning, not biological reality.

## What If My Partner Doesn't Like My Body?

This is one of the biggest fears women have about oral sex. Let's address it honestly:

### "What if I smell bad?"

If you've showered and are healthy, you don't smell bad. You smell like... you.

Natural body scent is normal and not offensive. Every body has a scent. Your partner, if they love you, won't be repelled by your natural smell.

If you're very worried: shower right before. Use plain water (no soap inside the vagina — remember, it's self-cleaning!).

**Red flag:** If there's an unusual smell (fishy, very strong, or unpleasant), see a doctor. You might have an infection that needs treatment. This isn't about being "dirty" — infections happen and are treatable.

### "What if the taste is bad?"

Healthy vulvas taste neutral to slightly salty. That's normal.

What you eat can affect taste slightly (pineapple and fruit = sweeter, garlic/onions = stronger), but the effect is mild.

Your partner chose to be intimate with you. They're not approaching this with disgust. They're approaching with love and desire.

### "What if my partner judges my body?"

Your vulva looks normal. Every vulva looks different (remember Chapter 2?), and they're all normal.

A loving partner won't judge your body negatively. They're focusing on giving you pleasure, not critiquing your appearance.

If your partner DOES make negative comments about your body, smell, or taste — that's a partner problem, not a body problem. Your body deserves respect.

## For Her: What It Feels Like

When done gently and consistently, oral sex on the clitoris can feel like:

- Warm, soft waves of sensation
- Building pleasure that's hard to escape
- A focused, intense feeling at exactly the right spot
- The climax arrives easier than with most other methods

Many women who struggle with orgasm during intercourse find it **much easier** during oral.

This is YOUR pleasure. You deserve to experience it.

## Tips for Him (If She Shares This)

If you share this section with your partner, here's what he should know:

### The Basics

- Focus on the clitoris (the small bump at the top)
- Use FLAT tongue, not pointed
- Gentle pressure, not hard pushing
- Slow, consistent rhythm
- Up-down or circular motions work well

### Important Rules

- Start GENTLE — the clitoris is very sensitive
- Listen to her sounds and body language
- If she says "right there" — DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING
- Keep going until she's done, not until YOU'RE tired

### Common Mistakes

- Going too fast or too hard too soon
- Changing rhythm constantly
- Stopping when she's almost there
- Treating it like a race, not a journey

## Communication During Oral Sex

Real-time feedback makes everything better. Don't stay silent — guide your partner!

### What SHE Can Say:

- "Right there" (when the spot is perfect)
- "A little softer/harder"
- "Keep that rhythm"
- "Don't stop" (especially when close to orgasm!)
- "That feels amazing"
- "Can you try moving in circles?"

### What HE Can Say:

- "Is this pressure good?"
- "Tell me what feels best"
- "Should I keep going like this?"
- "Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable"

### Non-Verbal Cues to Notice:

- Moaning (usually means good!)
- Body tensing (approaching climax)
- Pulling away slightly (might be too intense — ease up)
- Pushing closer or guiding with hands (wants more)

Listen to your partner's body and words. Adjust accordingly. This isn't a guessing game — it's a conversation.

## Common Concerns Specific to Women

Let's address the worries that keep women from fully enjoying oral sex:

### "What if it takes me a long time?"

That's completely normal! Many women need 10-20 minutes of consistent stimulation to reach orgasm.

A loving partner won't mind. Your pleasure is worth the time.

If your partner's jaw gets tired, they can switch to fingers for a bit, then return to mouth. Or combine both — fingers inside, tongue on clitoris.

**Don't rush yourself.** The pressure to "finish quickly" actually makes orgasm harder. Relax and enjoy the sensation.

### "What if I can't orgasm from it?"

First: even if you don't climax, the sensation can still feel wonderful. Pleasure doesn't require orgasm.

Second: remove the pressure. Tell yourself "I'm just going to enjoy this, whatever happens." Paradoxically, releasing pressure often helps orgasm happen naturally.

Third: if you rarely orgasm from anything, oral sex combined with relaxation and good communication gives you the best chance.

### "What about during my period?"

This is personal preference.

Some couples avoid oral sex during periods. Others don't mind, especially on lighter days with a tampon or menstrual cup in place.

There's no "right" answer. Discuss together. If either partner is uncomfortable, wait a few days. If both are okay with it, it's fine.

### "What if I'm too self-conscious to relax?"

Self-consciousness is the enemy of pleasure.

Try this: close your eyes. Focus on the sensation, not your thoughts. When your mind says "Does my body look okay?" redirect to "How does this FEEL?"

Over time, as you realize your partner genuinely enjoys giving you pleasure, self-consciousness fades.

**Your pleasure matters. Your body is worthy of pleasure. This is FOR you.**

## For Him: What About Receiving?

Oral sex for men (mouth on penis) is also pleasurable.

If you want to learn or try:

**Basic tips:**

- Use lips and tongue, not just up-and-down motion
- Cover your teeth with your lips
- Go at a comfortable pace for YOU
- It's okay to use hands at the same time
- You don't have to take it deep — just the tip + hand works well

**Important:** Never feel obligated. Only do what you're comfortable with. Some couples enjoy this, some don't. No pressure either way.

## Consent Is Everything

This is VERY important:

**Oral sex requires mutual consent.**

- No one should feel pressured
- Both partners should WANT to participate
- It's okay to say "not tonight" or "I'm not comfortable with that"
- It's also okay to try once, not like it, and never do it again

There's no rule that says you MUST do this. It's just another tool in the toolkit.

**But if you're curious:** give yourself permission to explore. Your body, your choice.

## Starting the Conversation

If you want to try oral sex (giving or receiving), how do you bring it up?

**Simple approaches:**

- "I read that oral sex helps many women orgasm. Would you be willing to try?"
- "I want to feel closer to you in new ways. Can we experiment?"
- "I'm curious about something. If either of us doesn't like it, we stop. No pressure."

Keep it light. No pressure. Just curiosity and love.

## Hygiene Tips

For both partners:

**Before oral sex:**

- Shower or wash the area with plain water
- Trim pubic hair if it's very long (optional, but can make things easier)
- Avoid strong foods like garlic or onion beforehand (affects taste/smell slightly)

**General:**

- Healthy people taste neutral
- Strange smell or taste could indicate infection — see a doctor
- Never perform oral sex if either partner has mouth sores or genital infections

## New Words You'll Know

**Oral sex**: Using the mouth/tongue for pleasure on genitals.

**Cunnilingus**: The technical term for oral sex on a woman (mouth on vulva/clitoris).

**Fellatio**: The technical term for oral sex on a man (mouth on penis).

## Something to Think About

Have you considered oral sex? If not, ask yourself honestly: Is it because you think it's "wrong"? But why? Is it because you're afraid it's dirty? (We've addressed that!) Is it simply new and unknown? New things feel scary. But sometimes they open doors to pleasure you never imagined. If you're curious, you have permission to explore. Your pleasure matters.
