# Chapter 7: Making It Work
## Intercourse Mechanics — Positions & Techniques

### A Little Story

Rekha and Amit tried sleeping on a small bed together.

*"Move your arm!"*
*"Your leg is crushing me!"*
*"This angle is uncomfortable!"*

After 10 minutes of adjusting, they finally found the perfect position. Both comfortable. Both cozy.

*"Why didn't we figure this out earlier?"* Rekha laughed.

*"Because we never TALKED about what was uncomfortable!"*

Sex is exactly like this.

### What We've Learned So Far

Let's recap:

✅ The clitoris is the pleasure center (Chapter 4)
✅ Arousal takes time — 15-30 minutes for women (Chapter 5)
✅ Most women need clitoral touch DURING sex, not just penetration (Chapter 6)

Now the practical question:

**HOW do we actually do this during sex?**

---

### The Basic Positions

There are many positions. Let's learn three simple ones that most couples start with:

**Position 1: Missionary (Face-to-Face)**
```
     Him: _____
          ↓    \
     Her: _____ \
          (lying on back)
```
- She lies on her back
- He is on top, facing her
- Most common position

**Position 2: Woman on Top**
```
     She: _____
          ↓    \  (sitting/leaning)
     Him: _____ 
          (lying on back)
```
- He lies on his back
- She sits or leans on top
- SHE controls the movement

**Position 3: Spooning (Side-by-Side)**
```
     Him: ___\
     Her: ___/  (both facing same direction)
```
- Both lie on their sides
- He is behind her
- Gentle, relaxed position

### The Clitoris Problem in Each Position

Now, here's the thing:

In most positions, the penis enters the vagina. But remember — the clitoris is OUTSIDE, above the vaginal opening.

**Missionary:** He's on top, not much contact with clitoris
**Woman on Top:** Better! Her clitoris can rub against his body
**Spooning:** Very little clitoral contact

So what do we do?

---

### Solution 1: Add Hands

This is the simplest fix:

**During missionary or spooning:**
- He can reach down with one hand and touch her clitoris
- OR she can touch herself while he is inside

Some people feel awkward about this at first.

But think about it — if both partners finish, who cares which hand helped?

**It's teamwork, not cheating!**

---

### Solution 2: Grinding Instead of Thrusting

Here's a secret:

The in-out "thrusting" motion is great for him, not for her.

But **grinding** — rocking back and forth together — can create friction between his body and her clitoris.

**Woman on Top** is best for this:
- Instead of bouncing up and down
- She rocks her hips forward and back
- Her clitoris rubs against his lower belly

*Less "porn movie" movement. More pleasure for her.*

---

### Solution 3: The Pillow Trick

A simple pillow can change everything.

```
     THE PILLOW TRICK (Missionary Position)
     
     Him: lying between her legs
          
     Her: ____/|\_____
              ↑
         Pillow under hips!
```

**How it helps:**
- Place a pillow under her lower back/hips
- This tilts her pelvis upward
- Changes the angle of penetration
- Can increase clitoral contact
- Also helps if penetration feels uncomfortable

Try different pillow heights to find what works.

### The Rhythm Secret

Another common problem:

**Constantly changing speed and position.**

Imagine you're climbing a ladder. Every few seconds, someone shakes the ladder and you slide back down. Frustrating!

**For her to climb to the peak, rhythm must stay CONSISTENT.**

Once she says *"yes, like that"* — **don't change anything!**

Same speed. Same angle. Same pressure.

Let her climb without interruption.

---

### Communication During Sex

Many couples feel awkward talking during intimacy.

But small words make a HUGE difference:

**Helpful things to say:**
- *"A little slower"*
- *"Yes, right there!"*
- *"Can you move your hand here?"*
- *"That feels good"*
- *"Let's try a different position"*

**How he can ask:**
- *"Is this good?"*
- *"Faster or slower?"*
- *"Tell me what you need"*

It doesn't have to be a speech. Just a few words. And it transforms everything.

---

### When to Change Position vs. Stay

Here's a simple rule:

**Change position if:**
- Something is uncomfortable or painful
- You've been in one position too long (tiredness)
- You want to try something new (usually early in the session)

**STAY in position if:**
- She's saying "yes, right there!"
- Her breathing is getting faster
- She seems close to the peak
- She specifically asks you not to stop

*When she's climbing, don't shake the ladder!*

---

### A Note About Pain

Sex should NOT hurt.

If something is painful:
- Stop or pause immediately
- Check the angle
- Add more lubrication
- Try a different position

Pain is your body saying *"something is wrong."*

Don't push through pain. Address it.

(We'll discuss pain in more detail in Chapter 12)

### New Words You'll Know

**Penetration** — When the penis enters the vagina.

**Thrust** — The in-and-out movement during sex.

**Grinding** — A rocking, rubbing movement instead of thrusting.

**Rhythm** — The speed and pattern of movement.

**Lubricant/Lube** — Slippery gel to reduce friction (natural or store-bought).

### Something to Think About

Which of these tips could help YOU?
- Adding hand touch?
- Grinding instead of thrusting?
- The pillow trick?
- Better communication?

Pick ONE to try next time. Small changes, big differences.

### Coming Up Next...

There's another way to give the clitoris attention — one that many couples find even MORE effective than hands.

It's the tongue. Soft, precise, and gentle.

Chapter 8 explores **"Using Your Mouth"** — oral sex basics for both partners.

This is a topic that some find uncomfortable. That's okay. Read it anyway. Knowledge removes fear. 👅
